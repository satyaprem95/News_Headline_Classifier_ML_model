# Overview
This project focuses on developing a machine learning classification model to predict the category of news articles or headlines. The goal is to accurately classify news into predefined categories such as Crime, Wellness, Politics, etc. This repository includes implementations of two machine learning models: Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

# Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Comprehensive preprocessing steps including data cleaning, lemmatization, and text normalization.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analysis to understand the data better and extract meaningful insights.

Vectorization: Utilized techniques like bigrams and TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.

Model Training: Implemented and compared two machine learning modelsâ€”Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Model Evaluation: Techniques for evaluating the performance of the models.

Prediction Function: A function to classify unknown news data and predict its category using the trained models.
